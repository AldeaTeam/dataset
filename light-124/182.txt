"question":"How does ResTv2 simplify the EMSA structure compared to ResTv1?","<ans>":"ResTv2 simplifies the EMSA (Efficient Multi-Scale Attention) structure compared to ResTv1 by eliminating the multi-head interaction part. In ResTv1, EMSA involves projecting the input token and splitting it into multiple groups (heads) for further processing. However, ResTv2 removes this multi-head interaction and employs an upsample operation to reconstruct the lost medium- and high-frequency information caused by the downsampling operation. This simplification in ResTv2's EMSA structure helps to streamline the model while still maintaining its effectiveness in multi-scale vision tasks. "
