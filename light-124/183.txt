"input":"The paper proposes a new neural architecture search (NAS) method called DASH (Diverse-task Architecture SearcH) that aims to efficiently solve diverse problems beyond computer vision. DASH searches for the right kernel sizes and dilations for a fixed standard convolutional network (CNN) topology, which expands the model's capacity to extract features at multiple resolutions for different types of data. To overcome the efficiency challenges of naive weight-sharing in this search space, DASH introduces a differentiable NAS algorithm that computes the mixture-of-operations using the Fourier diagonalization of convolution, achieving both a better asymptotic complexity and an up-to-10x search time speedup in practice. DASH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in aggregate on NAS-Bench-360, a suite of ten tasks designed for benchmarking NAS in diverse domains, attaining the best-known automated performance on seven tasks. Meanwhile, on six of the ten tasks, the combined search and retraining time is less than 2x slower than simply training a CNN backbone that is far less accurate.",
